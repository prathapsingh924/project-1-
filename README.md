# ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts

## Overview
This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for an ERC20 token and a vault contract. The ERC20 token contract implements the standard ERC20 interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The vault contract provides a secure storage mechanism for managing token deposits and withdrawals.

## ERC20 Token Contract
The ERC20 token contract defines the following functionalities:
- `transfer`: Transfer tokens from the sender's account to another address.
- `approve`: Approve another address to spend tokens on behalf of the sender.
- `transferFrom`: Transfer tokens from one address to another, provided the sender has been approved to do so.
- `balanceOf`: Get the token balance of a specific address.
- `allowance`: Get the remaining token allowance for a spender on behalf of the token owner.
- `totalSupply`: Get the total token supply.
- `mint`: Mint new tokens and assign them to the specified address.
- `burn`: Burn tokens from the sender's account.

## Vault Contract
The vault contract provides a secure mechanism for users to deposit and withdraw tokens. It interacts with the ERC20 token contract to handle token transfers. The following functionalities are implemented in the vault contract:
- `deposit`: Allows users to deposit tokens into the vault, minting shares equivalent to the deposited amount.
- `withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw tokens from the vault, burning shares and transferring the corresponding tokens back to the user's account.

## Usage
Once the contracts are deployed, you can use them for various purposes such as:
- Creating your own ERC20 token with custom name, symbol, and decimal precision.
- Managing token transfers between addresses securely.
- Depositing tokens into the vault for secure storage.
- Withdrawing tokens from the vault with proper authorization.
